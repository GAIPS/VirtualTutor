Yarn is to large to include in the build. Please download from https://github.com/InfiniteAmmoInc/Yarn. Place the compiled Yarn on BuildAssets/_RESPECTIVE_OS_/Yarn.

You can also see previously built releases of Previewer and get Yarn from there. https://github.com/RicardoEPRodrigues/VirtualTutor/releases/
